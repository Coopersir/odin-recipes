        <h2>A recipe handed down through generations</h2>
        <p>Invented by my great great great great great great great great great great great great</p>
        <p>great great great great great great great great grandfather during the Black Death</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Vegetable oil, for frying(about 5 cups)</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/4 cup cornmeal</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground dried thyme</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
                <li>3 adult rats(about 1 pound each)</li>
                <li>3 kebab sticks</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large cast-iron skillet with 1 inch of vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer
                    <br>registers 350 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, whisk the flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, thyme, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons
                    <br>pepper in a large bowl. Whisk the eggs and milk in another large bowl. Season the rats
                    <br>all over with salt and pepper. Dredge each rat in the flour mixture, then dip in the egg mixture,
                    <br>letting any excess drip off. Return the rats to the flour mixture and turn until well coated.
                    <br>Transfer to a large plate or baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Carefully add one rat to the hot oil. The oil temperature will drop; adjust the heat as needed
                    <br>to maintain a temperature of 350 degrees F. Fry the rat, without turning, until the crust
                    <br>starts browning, about 2 minutes. Flip the rat and continue cooking, turning occasionally,
                    <br>until browned and crisp all over and a thermometer inserted into the midsection registers
                    <br>160 degrees F, 13 to 16 minutes. Remove with tongs and transfer to a rack set on a baking sheet;
                    <br>sprinkle with salt. Let the oil temperature return to 350 degrees F before repeating with  the remaining rats.</li>
                <li>Insert kebab stick up the anus of each rat.</li>
            </ol>
